## How to Collaborate?
Collaborating on this Repository is really easy, you just have to push the code, but make sure you :
* Add some easy to understand comments.
* Give some meaningful variable & function names.
* Your filename should be easy to recognize. (For example, if you've made a program to print the sum of 2 integers, then the filename can be sum.c or something like that.)
